# ShoppingCart
Shopping Cart using Django  
Visit on cart.banvuong.com

Implemented Functionalities:  
•	Use sessions to support anonymous users as well as logged in user  
•	Every user who access the webpage for the first time will be given a “cart id” session stored in the database.   
•	If the users leave and come back at another time, their cookie would match with the session and whatever they have added in the cart from last time would show up  
•	Use Ajax to add/remove item from cart
